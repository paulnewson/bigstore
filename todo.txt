- DONE: misses copying versioned objects (MS working on this)

- DONE. bash "set -e" doesn't work; do explicit response code checks (RH working on this)

- DONE. If you attempt to relocate a bucket that you already relocated once, it
  finds the existing step log and concludes it's done, even if some params
  changed. For example I relocated my bucket to a different location, and
  then went to run it again to update to a different storage class, and
  it ran through both stages doing nothing. After sucessfully completing
  stage 2 we should rename the step log to <whatever>.COMPLETE so it's
  still around to be examined but won't intefere with future run attempts.

- DONE. Add some test cases that will automatically test all the different
  configurations and scenarios so that we don't regress when we make changes.

- DONE: Bug: after migration of a versioned bucket the relocate_check file remains (MS
  working on this)

- DONE: I tried to relocate two buckets, both containing 231 objects. It failed
  the first time with the 404 error; when I restarted it got to this point
  and failed more badly:
    Step 15: (gs://mfsbucket) - Delete the temporary bucket (gs://mfsbucket-relocate).
    (gs://mfsbucket): Completed.

- Add some retries to the bucket deletions. Sometimes when we delete a large
  number of objects, gsutil seems to return before all the objects have been
  deleted in the backend. If we do a remove bucket call immediately the
  call may fail because the bucket is not seen to be empty.
  RH: I've added 24 retries with 5s between each retry. That gives us 2 mins
  of total delay before we fail. Is this enough?

- Bug: I just tried migrating a versioned bucket from us/dra to eu/standard.
  at step 15 of stage 2 it printed:
    Removing gs://mfsbucket-relocate/...
    GSResponseError: status=404, code=NoSuchBucket, reason=Not Found.
    Failed to delete the temporary bucket:  gs://mfsbucket-relocate
  However, it actually did delete that temp bucket; and it didn't migrate the bucket.
  When I remove the /tmp log files and retried, it worked.

- Once I try to migrate a bucket with a few dozen+ objects, I see messages like this:
    GSResponseError: 404 Not Found
    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><Error><Code>NoSuchKey</Code><Message>The specified key does not exist.</Message></Error>
  If I restart the script it usually completes, but these are worrisome; any idea why they're happening?
  --> I was able to repro that error just running gsutil on the commandline,
  trying to delete all the objects in a largish bucket followed by deleting
  the bucket. I think this is just a consequence of our eventually consistent
  bucket listings, so the solution is a sleep 5/retry loop. I repeated several
  times (by hand) and was able eventually to delete the bucket.

- create a bunch of objects with various metadata and testing that they get relocated in full fidelity.
