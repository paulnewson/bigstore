- misses copying versioned objects (MS working on this)

- bash "set -e" doesn't work; do explicit response code checks (RH working on this)

- If you attempt to relocate a bucket that you already relocated once, it
finds the existing step log and concludes it's done, even if some params
changed. For example I relocated my bucket to a different location, and
then went to run it again to update to a different storage class, and
it ran through both stages doing nothing. After sucessfully completing
stage 2 we should rename the step log to <whatever>.COMPLETE so it's
still around to be examined but won't intefere with future run attempts.
