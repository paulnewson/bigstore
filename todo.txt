- misses copying versioned objects (MS working on this)

- DONE. bash "set -e" doesn't work; do explicit response code checks (RH working on this)

- DONE. If you attempt to relocate a bucket that you already relocated once, it
  finds the existing step log and concludes it's done, even if some params
  changed. For example I relocated my bucket to a different location, and
  then went to run it again to update to a different storage class, and
  it ran through both stages doing nothing. After sucessfully completing
  stage 2 we should rename the step log to <whatever>.COMPLETE so it's
  still around to be examined but won't intefere with future run attempts.

- DONE. Add some test cases that will automatically test all the different
  configurations and scenarios so that we don't regress when we make changes.

- Add some retries to the bucket deletions. Sometimes when we delete a large
  number of objects, gsutil seems to return before all the objects have been
  deleted in the backend. If we do a remove bucket call immediately the
  call may fail because the bucket is not seen to be empty.
